"""Multi-line quoted values, and the keys that must survive a stray quote.

``parse_text`` splits on ``splitlines()``, so a quoted value written across
physical lines used to be truncated at the first line and every later line
dropped as a stray non-assignment::

    KEY="first line
    second line"

reported ``KEY='"first line'`` and silently discarded ``second line``.

Closing that gap is easy to do destructively. The first attempt decided
"unclosed" by counting quote characters and then consumed following lines until
any matching quote appeared, never backtracking. On three ordinary lines that
heuristic reports an unclosed quote where there is none, and the accumulation
then ate every key after it::

    KEY="oops              -> KEY becomes '"oops\\nNEXT=keepme'; NEXT is gone
    KEY="v" # see "docs    -> the comment's quote reads as a false positive
    KEY="a \\" b"           -> the escaped quote reads as a false positive

That is the worse failure by far. env-drift's output is a comparison of key
sets, so a swallowed key does not look like a parse bug -- it is reported as
"exists only in production" for keys that are sitting in the file.

Each test below pins one behaviour, and the pair ``test_multiline_*`` /
``test_*_survives_a_stray_quote`` is what makes the set non-vacuous: the first
group fails on a tree without the fix, the second fails on a tree with a
naive one.
