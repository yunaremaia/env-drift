"""Cross-environment drift scanner.

The unit of work is a *snapshot*: one environment's parsed key/value pairs. The
scanner compares every pair of snapshots and emits one :class:`EnvDrift` per
inconsistency, so a finding always carries the full cross-environment context
for the key that drifted.

A plain value difference is **not** drift -- ``DEBUG=true`` in development and
``DEBUG=false`` in production is the whole point of separate env files. Drift is
reported for these checks:

``missing_key_in_env``
    The key exists in some environments and is absent from others.
``orphaned_key``
    The key exists in exactly one environment (dead config elsewhere).
``divergent_secret``
    A key declared in ``shared-keys`` holds different values per environment.
``format_mismatch``
    The same key holds values of different shapes (bool vs string, number vs
    duration) -- usually a typo or an unquoted value.
``empty_value``
    The key resolves to an empty string where another environment has a value.
``pending_removal``
    The key is commented out in one environment but still live in another.

Each finding carries the env file it is anchored to (:attr:`EnvDrift.path`) so
that :func:`env_drift.report.render_sarif` can report a repo-relative location.
